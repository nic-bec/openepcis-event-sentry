# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to set out some binding rules for all participants in the project work to create an open and welcoming environment in which contributors from all areas can work together freely and effectively.

## 2. Applicability

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants in the project. The project is an initiative in which companies voluntarily participate and contribute by providing development services ("Contributions") intended for free use by the general public.

The project is a loose and voluntary collaboration between different companies. Their participation does not constitute a contractual or other service exchange relationship, nor do they work together based on a legal partnership. All services are provided voluntarily and without consideration. The services are then made available to the general public free of charge under an open-source license.

**By participating in the project, you agree to the provisions of this Code of Conduct.**

## 3. Scope of application

The aim of the project is to develop an open-source tool in connection with EPCIS (working title: "EPCIS Profile Checker"). The purpose of this tool is to check whether EPCIS events comply with the requirements of a global, regional or local standard or a customer specification.

The scope should not include support for data other than visibility data (especially master data). All types of standardisation efforts are expressly excluded.

The development services shall be provided in a repository operated by benelog in accordance with its terms of use. This service of benelog is voluntary and free of charge. Neither benelog nor any other participant acts as operator of the project, and accordingly no legal claim can be made against any of them.

## 4. Intellectual property rights

Permission to license: All contributions to the project must be provided under an open-source license that provides permission for further free licensing, namely the "Apache 2.0" license. Contributions that are not provided under the "Apache 2.0" license will not be accepted.

No claims to intellectual property: Participants agree not to assert any intellectual property rights to their contributions once they have been made available. Contributions are made on the condition that they become part of the project's open-source repository and are freely available under the terms of the "Apache 2.0" license.

Contribution Agreement: By submitting contributions, you confirm that you are authorised to license the contributions under the "Apache 2.0" license and that the code is free from third party intellectual property claims.

## 5. Enforcement

Reporting Problems: If you become aware of a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to the project administrators.

Consequences: Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in temporary or permanent expulsion from the project by the project administrators.

## 6. Acknowledgement

By participating in this project, you acknowledge that you will not make any claims against other participants in the project or third parties regarding the contributions or your performance, unless participants or third parties use them in violation of the "Apache 2.0" license. You acknowledge that you have read this Code of Conduct and will abide by it. Your participation is conditional upon your acceptance of these terms.

## 7. Amendments

This Code of Conduct may be revised at regular intervals. Participants are expected to read and comply with the latest version available in the repository.
